# One fuzz burst: mutate a target for BUDGET seconds, then fold what it found into its corpus.
# Run by .github/workflows/fuzz.yml, and the same way locally from the repo root:
#
#   fuzz/burst.sh <libfuzzer-binary> <target> <budget-seconds>
#
#   cargo +nightly fuzz build layout_inject
#   fuzz/burst.sh fuzz/target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/layout_inject layout_inject 60
#
# Uses fuzz/dict/<target>.dict when it exists. Works in fuzz/corpus/<target> (replaced by the
# minimized union), fuzz/new/<target> (this burst's finds, emptied once merged) and
# fuzz/artifacts/<target>/ (crash-/timeout-/oom-/slow-unit- inputs). Mutates nothing else.
#
# Why the budget is timed here and not with -max_total_time alone: libFuzzer counts that budget
# from process start, and loading the corpus counts. In safe-chains, -max_total_time=2 over a 4k
# corpus spent ~10s loading and stopped at INITED having mutated nothing, and on a runner a 12k
# corpus took ~4.5 min to load. A flat budget against a growing corpus quietly becomes a replay.
# So the clock starts at INITED, and SIGINT ends the run. libFuzzer exits 72 on an interrupt (the
# cargo-fuzz build rejects -interrupted_exit_code), which is mapped to 0 here, and only when this
# script sent the interrupt.
#
# Finds go to a per-target fuzz/new/<target>, not a shared fuzz/new: run locally one target after
# another, a shared directory would merge one target's finds into the next target's corpus.
#
# Exit status: the fuzzer's, if it stopped on its own (a crash, timeout, oom or leak is non-zero);
# 0 after a clean interrupt; 2 if only the merge failed. The merge runs regardless, so the corpus
# keeps what the burst found before a crash. Under Actions, a successful merge sets the step output
# `merged=true`, which is what lets the workflow save the corpus.
